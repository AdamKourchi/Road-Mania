# 🚘 Car Obstacle Game

**Description:**  
A simple 2D endless driving game built with **pure JavaScript** and the **HTML Canvas API**.

This project simulates an endless road where the player must avoid obstacles while collecting points.  
It’s powered entirely by browser-native technologies — no frameworks, just **vanilla JS**, **Canvas drawing**, and **basic physics logic**.  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **game loops**, **real-time rendering**, and **collision detection**.
